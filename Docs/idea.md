# Mission

Composers Distilled shortens the gap between academic approach to classical music and listening to actual music through the streaming services. It simplifies discovery and boosts accessibility.

## Problem

There are 100+ composers I track. Each composer has hundreds of works in different genres. Each work has numerous performers. Some performers have several records of the same work. Recordings may have remasters. That is a very long chain that requires time and effort from a person who is interested in classical music and wants to explore the world outside of Beethoven's symphonies performed by Karajan. Streaming services do not help much: even the specialised resources like Primephonic or Idagio have clunky interface.

## Solution

Composers Distilled is a web service that provides a simple structure for the works of classical music with curated content and direct links to streaming services.

It goes like that:
- You start with musical periods, like late baroque or contemporary.
- You observe the important and interesting composers in each period. Not everyone from Wikipedia, and not the top 5 most famous, but a balance selection. You choose one.
- You explore the works of the selected composer grouped by genres. Again, not all 200+ cantatas Bach wrote, but 20 really good ones. Yes, something will be omitted, maybe something a fan of Bach considers super important. Gotta deal with it. Anyway, you select a work.
- Then you see several great recordings of that work. And each recording has a button, you press the button and streaming app client opens for the selected work in selected performance, and you can start listening.
- The experience will be available on desktop and mobile, of course. It's fine to listen to classical music on mobile.

## Who is this for

- All people who want to discover great classical music.
- People who like music, tech and convenience.
